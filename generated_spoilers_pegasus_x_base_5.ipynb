Maybe a job driving the Big Idaho Potato Truck is the career you’ve been looking for The promotional vehicle, which consists of a semi cab hauling a 12foottall replica potato, travels around the United States to draw attention to the prize spuds of Idaho Operated by the Idaho Potato Commission, the truck is currently on its fifth annual tour of the country Funding concerns mean this could be the last year, but a recent, unexpected endorsement from Kobe Bryant—he namedropped the truck in an ESPN interview—may have helped secure its future To find out what life on the road with the Big Potato is really like we spoke with Larry Bathe, who is not only the current driver of the trailer, but has been with the project since the very beginning The Big Idaho Potato Truck first hit the road in 2012, as a promotional tour commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Idaho Potato Commission As Bathe told us, the idea for the truck came from Linda Kaufman of marketing company Foerstel Design, who was inspired by an old novelty postcard that showed an impossibly massive potato on the back of a flatbed Bathe, a lifelong truck driver, was brought in to help figure out exactly how to create and pilot a giant potato around the country Originally, the huge tater was set to be 16 feet tall, and hold a museum inside, but at that scale it wouldn’t have fit under most bridges The potato creators scaled the tater back to its current 12foottall size, and began to test drive it, which is when Bathe first took the wheel The truck did its first ninemonth tour in 2012, mostly visiting grocery stores to hand out information on Idaho spuds That was supposed to be the extent of its service celebrating the Potato Commission’s anniversary, but the vehicle proved so popular that it was allowed to hit the road again in 2013 More and more venues began requesting that the truck make an appearance, from Nascar events to the Kentucky Derby After the Big Idaho Potato Truck’s second tour it had gained so much notice that the program was given a threeyear contract, 2016 being its final guaranteed year Some people love it in the commission, and some people don’t, or at least they act like they don’t, says Bathe But in the end we win them over pretty easily Despite yearly funding worries, the Big Idaho Potato Truck continues chugging along Having turned down the first two tours to be with his family, Bathe returned to the truck tour in 2014 He has driven the potato every year since According to Bathe, driving around with the heavy carb load is both challenging and rewarding The potato is 12 feet wide and 28 feet long, making it nearly impossible to see what’s directly behind it It’s difficult for mirrors to see behind it, so I don’t have an idea of the traffic pattern behind the truck, says Bathe Turning the huge tater is also a challenge, that Bathe nearly always has to navigate by instinct and experience But the driver of the Big Idaho Potato Truck is not alone There are also two other ambassadors on board who look after the logistics of the tour In addition to the responsibility to interact with the public that each of the potato team shares, one of the ambassadors takes care of photography, video, and other documentation, while the other looks after social media and managing the venues and locations It takes a team to drive a sixton potato All three of the team ride in the cab while they are on the road, but the Big Potato itself isn’t empty You can’t have something that can’t be inspected inside, be as big as that potato, says Bathe To allow for this, there is a door in the potato that leads to the hollow insides which have been fitted with shelves and lockers for the potato team to store their stuff Even with the close quarters and the challenges of driving a giant potato around, Bathe loves his gig The amount of people that wave at you every day when you’re driving the Big Idaho Potato is just outrageous, he says I get thumbs up, waves, people taking pictures It’s just a feelgood job Since each year could possibly be the last for the truck, its overseers have ended up filling the positions last minute But Bathe hopes that this will change as the popularity of the Big Potato Truck grows, along with its crew Oscar Mayer’s promotional, gianthotdogshaped Wienermobile is 80 years old, Bathe points out The Big Potato is just five years old It’s just getting going</td>\n",

For 24yearold Graham McMillan, the answer is simple there is simply no limit to what he would do for his friends So, when his buddy Danny Kolzow, a 23yearold nurse at Baylor All Saints in Fort Worth, TX, found himself in need of a kidney, McMillan didn’t hesitate to find out if he could donate one of his As it turned out, he was a match He decided to surprise his friend with the good news, and did so in the most incredible way In this emotional clip, McMillan walks into the hospital where Kolzow works He has balloons and a sign in hand that reads, Heard urine need of a kidney, want mine? It seems like the young man is quite the jokester The moment Kolzow sees him, he understandably breaks down into tears He can barely believe his good luck not only does he get a kidney, but he knows that he also has a great friend who will be by his side through thick and thin The gift of life and the gift of friendship are both priceless\"}\n"
